League-wide, RHBLHP was most favorable for HR, w LHBLHP considerably least:

1 TRUE           L           L 0.02140484

4 TRUE           R           R 0.02902631

Why is PIT adjusted down?  They had comparatively fewer matchups (14.7% v 20.2%)
and (33% v 40%) for the two most conducive bpcombo (RHBLHP, RHBRHP), also more 
matchups (8% v 7.1%) for least conducive.

Same story for SFN?  Comparing the table below w league wide bpcombo freqs,
we see elevated LHBLHP (+37% !) and RHBLHP and depressed RHBRHP

In fact, let us just  express the team bpfreq relative to the league wide freq using division:

bpfrq.sfn / bpfrqs.2022
 PIT_HAND_CD
BAT_HAND_CD         L         R
          L 1.3750007 0.9982945
          R 1.1718540 0.8484436
The RL and RR just about cancel, so the adjustment due to inflated LL.

One more: the White Sox.  Look at this, 59% fewer LL matchups, but also 28% fewer RL matchups.
This 28% fewer results in an adjustment down I suppose.

> bpfrq.CHA/bpfrqs.2022
           PIT_HAND_CD
BAT_HAND_CD         L         R
          L 0.4169095 0.9395374
          R 0.7242621 1.2908871

How about a table with these frequencies relative to league-wide, for the teams with the
largest adjustments:





# Batter hand marginals
# Pitcher hand marginals
# Conditionally on batter hand
# Conditionally on pitcher hand
